-Must specify both .c and .h files as prerequisits in make.
-Dissable the pic if not used, otherwise it might generate df (vector 8) interrupts
-__attribute__((packed)) could be important if creating structs to match memory locations (e.g. descriptors)
-returning from an interrupt can not be done in C (at least not without the right attributes) because the stack will get fucked
-very important with clobbeered registers, i.e. telling the compiler which register you have used in an __asm__ statement




stuff that might cause trouble:

printf, what happens if str contains %, what happens if arg string contains %?

-in qemu, the command ring continunes processing commands even if the event ring is full,
probably not how real hardware works, but migh have to solve this

-for some reason a event TRB segment with n slots, only reciveces n-1 events (including event ring full event)
-does segmenting work (command ring probably works but event ring is unsure)

on other hardware:
    A-20 line might not get enabled corectly
    Currently assumes that an apic is present
SERIOUS: interrupts 0-31 are all assumed to be caused by exceptions that generate error codes (stack will get fucked otherwise)

   __asm__ volatile ("mov 0x8(%%ebp), %0" : "=r"(v3));*/

Alignment of data referenced by the data buffer lo and hi in a data stage TRB might need to be 64 / 128 bit aligned for
qemu for example. Although it is only recomended (p.470)
   

APIC:
Registers start at: FEE00000H. and uses 4KB of space. (Strong uncachable?)
can relocate, on MP (multiprocessor system) all are located at the same place to begin with
register allignade till 128, finns 32,64,,256 bitar breda register
cpuid to se if it exists, 
on systems with 3 wire buss it can not be enabled on the fly. When enabling prevent interupts. When dissabling config state could be lost
also has a software enable/dissable flag, when dissabled don't try to change the mask. THE APIC does some stuff even when dissabled: IPI
(INIT Reset is a thing)
when low double word of ICR is written to, APIC creates IPI message in ICR register.
Skriva till EOI(ENd or interrupt) n채r man 채r klar



=r betyder anv채nd vilket register som helst(r), och skit i startv채rdet (=)

xhc:
little endian, lower addresses contain least significant

The following struct is taking 5 bytes of space
but if uint16_t other is replaced with uint16_t other : 16
the struct only takes 4 bytes of space
typedef volatile struct{
   uint8_t CCS : 1;
   uint16_t other;
   uint8_t CSC : 1;
   uint16_t other2 : 14;
}__attribute__((packed))PortStatusAndControll;

IF A PCI DEVICE USES DMA IT MUST HAVE THE BUS MASTER (PCI COMMAND REGISTER BIT 2) SET TO 1 IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE BUS AND READ MEMORY!!!!!!!!!
